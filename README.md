# scrapy-crawler

This spider was created utilizing Scrapy for a group project. Our group will be creating a website that will utilize this scraper to get information for the user.
I am writing it to go onto google and procede to scrape the name and url of the websites that populate and then to enter the website and get the cheapest product from the page; It will display the product name, price, and URL; perhaps also the image of the product.
